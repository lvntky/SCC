# SCC | Simple C Compiler

SCC is a simple, self-compiling C compiler that works on x86_64 machines.

SCC is a C compiler written in C language. This compiler can compile itself. You can run and use x86_64 on any Linux Machine.

## Getting Started

You can clone this repo to your local machine and dive into code. 

### Prerequisites

You may need `base-devel` package for build this project on to your computer. This package name can be change distro to distro. It's `base-devel` for Arch Linux and `build-essentials` for Debian based systems, but you need to figure it out what your distro provides.

For Arch Based Systems
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
```

For Debian Based Systems
```
sudo apt-get install built-essantials
```
